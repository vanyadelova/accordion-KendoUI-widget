# ðŸ“š Accordion widget using KendoUI ðŸ“š
## [DEMO](https://accordion-widget.netlify.app/)

## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the NGT's Frontend Developer Test. The goal of this test is to create a small dashboard with a page that displays a summary of multiple
results. The app consumes the data from the Firebase database and display it in a mini front-end dashboard. The app should include the following features:

- **Can be initialized either from markup, data object or KendoUI datasource**
- **Supports templates when bound to datasourcet**
- **Can expand / collapse items**
- **Support animations when expanding / collapsing**
- **Working code**
- **Readme**



It is a ReactJS Web-App using Firebase as a backend database..
